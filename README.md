# Inspiration
What is the first website you use when looking for quick information on a subject? Is it WikiPedia? Google Images? Maybe YouTube? For us it is all three! When it comes to looking something up on Wikipedia, we found that we were always wanting just a little bit more in terms of related information on the subject. By combining Wikipedia, YouTube, and Getty Images API's, we were able to create an application where a user has access to just the right amount of information all in one place.

# Application
Olahuli is a front-end web application that allows users to conduct a Wikipedia search and obtain wiki information in addition to related images and YouTube videos all in one place.

# Built With
Olahuli is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. Search results are provided using Wikipedia API, Getty Images API, and YouTube API. The application is currently deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
